README

This is a hack to Joomla 2.5's core com_content component that loads modules at the bottom of specific articles. In this case, we use a Custom HTML module with the bio information of an author and select it for their pieces of content. This makes it easier to make changes to one module in order to change the content across many different articles.

The hack consists of changes to two files: administrator\components\com_content\models\forms\article.xml and a custom default.php stored in your template's html folder (line 182).
